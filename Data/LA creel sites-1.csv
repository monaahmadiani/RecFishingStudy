179,4156,Freeport Canal,Civic Drive,Port Sulphur,Site is located over a levee on a short gravel road that runs behind the South Plaquemines school building.,"Site is located over a levee on a short gravel road that runs behind the South Plaquemines school building.  Anglers park on either side of the levee.  The site is mostly small boat anglers with some shore activity.  There is no ramp, but a gradual ?washout? at the end of the gravel road suffices as a launch.  
Due to the condition of the site, it is highly unlikely charter or offshore activities are present.  
It is my opinion that all assignments at this site should be AM for the safety of staff.  The site is at the end of a lightly traveled road with no lighting or restroom facilities.  
As a matter of interest, a funding request for construction of a pier/tie-up dock was make by the parish to the Department?s Wallop-Breaux boating access program.  The request was recommended for approval by the review committee.
